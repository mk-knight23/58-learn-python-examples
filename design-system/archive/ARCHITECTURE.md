# Architecture: 25-python-mixed-examples

## Overview
A comprehensive technical anthology and visualization engine for Python algorithms. It features a React 19 frontend designed as an "AlgoViz Lab," providing high-fidelity visual simulations of core computational logic alongside a massive repository of mixed Python examples.

## Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React 19
-   **Build Tool**: Vite 6
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion 12
-   **Visualizer**: AnimatePresence-driven bar orchestration for algorithm simulation.

## Core Logic
-   **Visualization Engine**: Dynamic React 19 state management for simulating Bubblesort, Binary Search, and other algorithmic patterns with real-time HUD feedback.
-   **Algorithm Library**: Decentralized collection of 100+ Python scripts covering everything from basic math to game development and socket programming.
-   **Complexity HUD**: Informational overlay providing time (O-notation) and space complexity analysis for selected algorithms.
-   **Anthology Hub**: Browsable interface for navigating the vast collection of specialized Python utilities.

## Performance
-   React 19 native rendering for ultra-fluid visualization updates.
-   Tailwind v4 native architecture for minimal CSS bundle size in the complex laboratory UI.
-   Vite 6 optimized HMR for rapid development of new visualization modules.
